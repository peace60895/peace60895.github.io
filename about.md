Welcome to **Braving Controversy**.

Currently, this site is an informal social experiment aimed at improving the way we navigate controversial material online. 

There are two main types of posts on this blog: (a) posts advancing/debating a position, (b) posts aimed at improving the way we process and develop our ideas. In type-a posts, we strive to use sources and counterarguments, thinking critically about the use of pathos. Posts are not bias free. They are constructed through an author’s worldview and crafted for a particular audience. Bias, however, is a frequent topic addressed in type-b posts. Type-b posts are necessary to not only reflect on critical issues that arise in the process of navigating controversy, but to offer support and sensitivity toward all journeyers who choose to brave the discomfort of navigating controversy. 

### Personal note about the creator
My name is Sam. One of my main areas of focus both academically and personally is the inner process of navigating controversy. Ever since I can recall using the web, I felt bombarded by ad hominem attacks and manipulative pathos. Examples of impoverished ways of handling controversy are abundant and likely will not decrease anytime soon. Despite this reality, I am learning that there is a minority of individuals that navigate controversy well. The process of braving controversy is messy. That is something I continue to learn as a clinical psychology graduate student. Yet, when it comes to controversy, I have to make the choice to embrace the messiness and pain of continuing to wrestle with ideas. To let go of patterns of avoidance and fear: trusting that a deeper level of peace awaits beneath the tension. 

### Authors’ Note
When creating this site, my vision is that this blog will be a group endeavor. Authors are welcome to craft and shape their posts without censorship, adhering to the importance of critical thinking and sensitivity. Each author is responsible for her or his thoughts in a given post. In posting, the author shares in the ownership of the site. Comments regarding each post should be directed to the author. Currently, authorship is not “open” to the public, primarily because this site is still being developed and constructed. Nevertheless, if you have specific feedback, questions, or want to be an author, do not hesitate to [contact me](mailto:sam.millereshleman@gmail.com) with your thoughts. 


As a closing note, I want to offer a special thank you to everyone who has made this blog possible. First, thank you to the authors for your thoughtful posts and active participation. Second, thank you to readers who, in one way or another, are developing the courage to brave controversy. Finally, I want to extend a special thank you to [Micah](https://micahjon.com/), our web developer.
